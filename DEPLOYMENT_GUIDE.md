## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "ModuleNotFoundError"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### CSV File Not Found
Make sure `roland_garros_finals_2000_2025.csv` is in the same directory as `app.py`

#### Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fails
1. Check that all files are uploaded to GitHub
2. Verify `requirements.txt` is in the root directory
3. Ensure CSV file has the correct name and format

#### App Loads Slowly
- This is normal for first load on Streamlit Cloud
- Subsequent loads are much faster
- Consider adding `@st.cache_data` decorators for heavy computations
